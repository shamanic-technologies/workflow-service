/**
 * What `?status=` means on the two workflow listings (`GET /workflows` and
 * `GET /public/workflows`).
 *
 * A workflow is only runnable when BOTH status axes say so: its own per-version
 * `status` is 'active' AND its dynasty's `workflow_dynasty_status` is 'active'.
 * The listings are what rankers and pickers read to choose something to run
 * (campaign-service provisions a campaign off `status=active`;
 * features-service builds its projection off `/public/workflows`), so "active"
 * on those surfaces has to mean *executable* rather than merely
 * "this version is the latest of its lineage". Otherwise a retired dynasty keeps
 * being offered, gets picked, and every resulting execute is refused with a 410.
 *
 * The three cases partition the same set: `retired` is exactly the complement of
 * `executable`, and `all` is their union.
