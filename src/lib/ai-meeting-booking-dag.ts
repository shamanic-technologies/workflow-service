/**
 * The DAG of the `ai-meeting-booking` channel.
 *
 * One run answers EXACTLY ONE prospect who is owed a message on this campaign:
 * it claims them, reads what they wrote and what we already sent, drafts an
 * answer to the question they actually asked, offers two concrete slots taken
 * from the brand's booking page in the prospect's own timezone, sends it as a
 * reply in their existing thread, and only THEN records what it did and when
 * the next follow-up is owed.
 *
 * Three things this DAG deliberately does NOT do, because another service
 * already owns them:
 *
 *  - It does not decide WHO to answer, in what order, or when to stop. That is
 *    lead-service's follow-up queue: `POST /orgs/campaigns/{predecessorCampaignId}/followups/claim-next`
 *    hands out at most one person, exactly once, oldest-due-first, with an
 *    atomic claim — so two concurrent runs can never answer the same person.
 *  - It does not resolve WHICH MAILBOX answers. instantly-service reads that
 *    off the mailbox that originally contacted the prospect; a caller-supplied
 *    from-address is exactly the failure `POST /orgs/replies` exists to prevent.
 *  - It does not compute the next due date by a fixed ladder. The date is
 *    chosen per lead, because a prospect who writes "recontact me in January"
 *    must be honoured; lead-service stores it rather than deriving it.
 *
 * ONE MORE THING IT DOES NOT OWN, and it is the reason this workflow answered
 * nobody for its first two weeks: WHICH CAMPAIGN holds the person. A funnel is
 * several LEGS and campaign-service mints one campaign per leg, so the prospect
 * this run must answer replied to the PREVIOUS leg — the cold email — and the
 * person, the thread and the record of what we owe them are all filed under
 * THAT campaign. Asking this workflow's own campaign for them finds nobody,
 * every run, forever, and "nobody due" is indistinguishable from there being
 * nothing to do, which is why it went unnoticed.
 *
 * So the flow RESOLVES the preceding leg's campaign itself, before it claims
 * anyone: `GET /internal/campaigns/{campaignId}/predecessor` states it, or
 * NAMES why there is none. It is resolved by the flow rather than handed to it
 * because most runs are scheduled and have no trigger to hand anything over.
 * Every lead-facing hop — the claim, the lead read, the conversation read, the
 * reply — then names the PREDECESSOR's campaign. The gate, the run accounting
 * and the offer/funnel read keep naming the campaign this run was DISPATCHED
 * for: money belongs to the leg that spends it.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO fallback to this run's own campaign when there is no
 * predecessor. That is precisely the behaviour that claimed nobody and 404'd,
 * and making it the fallback would hide the failure a second time. A run with
 * no predecessor ends on its own named branch, having sent nothing.
 *
 * The single stated degradation: if the booking page cannot be read, the reply
 * still goes out with the plain booking link and no slots, logged loudly.
 * Everything else fails loud and lands on the error branch.
