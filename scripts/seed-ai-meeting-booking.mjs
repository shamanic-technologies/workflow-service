/**
 * Ops script: stand up the workflow behind the `ai-meeting-booking` channel.
 *
 * The channel answers the prospects who showed sales interest and books the
 * meeting: it performs the `conversation_to_meeting_booked` leg of the
 * `sales_meetings_from_conversation` funnel. Everything underneath it already
 * runs; this is the thing that runs.
 *
 * ONE dynasty, not a matrix. The cold-email channels fan out across prompt
 * angles and models because they are looking for the one that converts; there
 * is nothing to compare here yet — the first question is whether the answer
 * lands at all, and a second cell would only split the evidence.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCE — enforced HERE as well as by the route. `POST /workflows` answers
 * a clean 409 on a duplicate signature, but a 409 per already-covered cell is
 * noise and it is what makes a rate-limited batch impossible to resume. So the
 * script reads the feature's active workflows first and creates only what is
 * missing. Re-running is safe, and the dry run walks the same path as the real
 * one.
 *
 * Usage, from inside the workflow-service container:
 *
 *   node seed-ai-meeting-booking.mjs            # dry run
 *   node seed-ai-meeting-booking.mjs --apply
 *
 * Env: WORKFLOW_SERVICE_API_KEY (required), BASE_URL (default localhost:8080),
 *      ORG_ID (default below).
